# CPM-File-System
This project simulates a CP/M file system to perform tasks like listing directory entries,  rename files, copy files, delete files, as well as read/write/open/close files.
In order to simulate this, a version of file system used on 5.25" and 8" floppy disks in the 90's has been used.

          Please run the file "cpmfsys.c" to execute this project.
